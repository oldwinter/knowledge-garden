### UNLOCK THE WAY YOUR IDEAS EVOLVE.

The ENCODE framework gives you the keys to reliably unstick your thinking so you can generate more meaningful insights and spend more time doing your best work.

We encounter ideas << and >> We express ideas

We can't avoid it. But we can get better at it.  
The ENCODE Framework describes how  
your knowledge evolves.

- **E**ncounter new ideas
- **N**ote the ideas that interest you
- **C**onnect ideas to things you know
- **O**rganize ideas so you can find them
- **D**evelop ideas to generate new insights
- **E**xpress your ideas to others

Creative expression is NOT a linear process. ENCODE is our diagnostic tool to  
decode where you are locked, so every part of you can be playing in sync.
