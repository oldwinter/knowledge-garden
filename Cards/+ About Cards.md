The cards folder is one of my favorite places because it has **umami**. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitterness, and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind.

You may have a few subfolders here too. I have a "People" subfolder. If I was an amateur chef with a growing number of recipe notes, I'd put a "Recipes" folder here. If I was making building a personal library of important exercises, I'd likely make an "Exercises" folder.

So, what are "cards"? Anything that is a bit of knowledge that you might call a "thing" or a "statement about things".

Yes, the definition is not rigid, but it works.
