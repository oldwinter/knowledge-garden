up:: [[ACCESS 笔记组织法]]

## 我的理解

虽然叫[[永久笔记]]permanent note，但个人理解其实更贴切的翻译是常青笔记evergreen note。一来，根据形式，和[[闪念笔记]]与[[文献笔记]]区分开。二来，根据目的，它是永恒且发展的，能为将来所用的永久笔记。

暂时先把日常片段式的思考和闪念，以短小的[[卡片笔记]]的方式，直接丢到这里，不强调文件夹分类，而是尝试通过特殊文件名、标签和链接等方式，让这些笔记具备可发现性，更容易被将来的自己找到。

总而言之，就是悬而未定的但已经有所思考的零散笔记，就丢这里面，期待将来逐步被发现，被结构化，被整理。

这里的[[MOC]]是事后总结归纳，不强调完备性。

一些临时的，pending的又不舍得删除的笔记先放到Pending文件夹里，等以后再处理。

## 原文解释

The cards folder is one of my favorite places because it has*umami*. Apparently umami is one of the five basic tastes. There are: Sweetness, Sourness, Saltiness, Bitterness—and that oddball Umami.

Umami is hard to describe but you know when it's there. The same is true of this folder's contents. It's a mixture of insights and ideas, concepts and connections, all mingling together to create that mysterious full mouthfeel that magnificently completes any meal for the mind.

So, what are "cards"? Anything that is a bit of knowledge that you might call a "thing" or a "statement about things".

Yes, the definition is not rigid, but it works.

Over time, you may have a few subfolders here too. I have a "People" subfolder. If I was an amateur chef with a growing number of recipe notes, I'd put a "Recipes" folder here. If I was making building a personal library of important exercises, I'd likely make an "Exercises" folder.

[[Information that crosses our attentional filter becomes knowledge]].
