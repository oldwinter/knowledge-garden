 promptId: modPhotorealistic
 name: üñºÔ∏è Generate a Photorealistic photo 
 description: This will make the art have a lot of detail, but still be stylized, and it will still be art. Do NOT use this if you want to create a prompt which looks like a real photo, as the term ‚Äúphotorealistic‚Äù is used to describe an artificial image that looks real, not a real photo.
