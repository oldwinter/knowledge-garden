## 我的理解

以时间和日期为依托的笔记都放Calendar文件夹下，以便将来回顾笔记时，有时间线索作为依据。

## 原文解释

This folder called "Calendar" is mostly empty because this is just a starter kit and my daily notes are personal. Think about what notes you might want to sort by date. Here are some common types:

- Daily Notes
- Meeting Notes
- Workout Notes
- Log Notes
- Tracking Notes
- Outputted Materials: Articles, Speeches, etc
