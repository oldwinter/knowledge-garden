up:: [[ACCESS 笔记组织法]]

## 我的理解

其实就是[[PARA]]，SPACES以项目action为目标，进行信息管理。但多了一个[[MOC]]，把信息串起来。我直接将其改成PARA。moc先直接放到对应文件夹里面。  
与Source相比，Spaces就像社会人，高目的性，一切以项目、闭环、完成为目标。而Source就像学生，低目的性，重在持续积累，分类，持续精进。

# About Spaces

Spaces are one of the most important parts of ACCESS: Whenever you have something big in your life, deploy a space and set up MAPS (MOCs, Areas, Projects, Support notes).

"Spaces" is more flexible than "projects" and more versatile than "areas".

Spaces contain both.

Spaces are the biggest spaces of effort in your work and personal life.

Here are other examples of when you can deploy a new space:

- shared folders for collaboration
- special folders to share publicly
- big hard-to-define things
- and whatever else demands its own space!

## maps

1. **MAPS**: Remember the tension between “folders vs links”? Here’s part of the solution: Use MOCs. It’s actually quite simple. For every space you have in your life, you just deploy the MAPS folder structure:
    - _**MOCs**_: Dashboards for your space.
    - _**Areas**_: subfolders containing relevant notes that are ongoing.
    - _**Projects**_: subfolders containing relevant notes with end dates.
    - _**Support notes**_: hold notes specific to that space!
