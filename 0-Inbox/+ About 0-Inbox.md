up:: [[ACCESS 笔记组织法]]

# About Inbox
This is a space to store notes as you capture them.

- Have a fresh idea that you want to reassess in a few days to see if it's still exciting? Store it in the **Cooling Pad** folder.
- The **Unsorted** folder is a great place to put notes you don't yet have time to properly categorize.

Regardless of which folder you use, ideally you're returning to these notes later on to properly place them within the ACCESS framework.
