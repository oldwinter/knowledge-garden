 * @param escapeVariables If true, special characters in variable values are quoted (but this might be prevented if a variable starts with {{! instead of {{ ). If false, dno escaping is ever done.
 * @param t_shell_command Will only be used to read default value configurations. Can be null if no TShellCommand is available, but then no default values can be accessed.
 * @param sc_event Use undefined, if parsing is not happening during an event.
 * @param variables If you want to parse only a certain set of variables, define them in this parameter. If this is omitted, all variables will be parsed.
 * @param raw_value_augmenter A callback that will be called before every substitution. Allows modifying or completely changing the resulted variable values.
 * @param escaped_value_augmenter Same as raw_value_augmenter, but called after escaping the value. Can be used to for example wrap values in html elements for displaying purposes.

/**
 * ParsingProcess instances can be used in situations where it's uncertain can all variables be parsed at the time being,
 * i.e. when parsing shell commands (and aliases), as they can have preactions which require parsing to be done in two phases.
 *
 * Also, shell commands are often parsed in advance for command palette and context menus. Then it's good to store the parsing
 * result by using instances of this class.
 *
 * Then again, if the parsing use-case is simpler, e.g. Prompt description or prompt field values, it's more straightforward
 * to just call parseVariables() without utilising this class. After all, this class is a wrapper for parseVariables().
 *
 * <ParsingMap> is a generalization for defining keys for an object that will be used for submitting the original parseable
 * content. The same keys will then be used to form another object containing the parsing results.

 * Copied 2021-10-29 from https://gist.github.com/TheDistantSea/8021359
 * Modifications:
 *  - Made compatible with TypeScript by adding type definitions.
 *  - Changed var to let.
 *
 * Compares two software version numbers (e.g. "1.7.1" or "1.2b").
 *
 * This function was born in http://stackoverflow.com/a/6832721.
 *
 * @param {string} v1 The first version to be compared.
 * @param {string} v2 The second version to be compared.
 * @param {object} [options] Optional flags that affect comparison behavior:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>lexicographical: true</tt> compares each part of the version strings lexicographically instead of
 *         naturally; this allows suffixes such as "b" or "dev" but will cause "1.10" to be considered smaller than
 *         "1.2".
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <tt>zeroExtend: true</tt> changes the result if one version string has less parts than the other. In
 *         this case the shorter string will be padded with "zero" parts instead of being considered smaller.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * @returns {number|NaN}
 * <ul>
 *    <li>0 if the versions are equal</li>
 *    <li>a negative integer iff v1 < v2</li>
 *    <li>a positive integer iff v1 > v2</li>
 *    <li>NaN if either version string is in the wrong format</li>
 * </ul>
